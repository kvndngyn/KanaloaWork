    - Deciding which direction to move forward with this
        - Use an existing package or continue working on the one made from scratch
    - Discussing how we can leave the code so that newer members will be able to easily catch up
        - Commenting on code
        - Block diagrams
        - GitHub wiki

    - Organization
    - Productive
    - Consistency
    - Are we using the most out of it?
        - Branches
        - Project Boards
        - Issues
    - Overall, how can the team more effectively use GitHub in software development rather than just a code repo

27 January 2021
- Sensor Fusion Meeting
    - Team updates
    - Received feedback
        - There are currently different versions of the same code
            - We can utilize branches to keep the Main branch the most up-to-date code 
                - Branches should be used to work on code then merged into Main branch once working and done
            - [Reference Repository](https://github.com/riplaboratory/Kanaloa/tree/master/SurfaceVehicles/WAMV/Arduino/MainMega)
